            <p className="text-red-200 leading-relaxed">
              Trading leveraged derivative products such as Foreign Exchange
              (Forex), Contracts for Difference (CFDs), or other financial
              derivative products carry a high level of risk to your capital.
              All these products, which are leveraged derivative products, may
              not be appropriate for all investors without an expert. The effect
              of leverage is that both gains and losses are magnified. The
              prices of leveraged derivative products may change to your
              disadvantage very quickly, you can lose more than your invested
              capital, and you may be required to make further payments. Before
              deciding to invest in any financial product, you should carefully
              consider your investment objectives, trading knowledge and
              experience, and affordability. You should only trade in Forex and
              CFDs if you have sufficient knowledge and experience of the risky
              nature of the products, the risks involved in trading such
              products, and if you are dealing with money that you can afford to
              lose. You should seek independent professional financial advice if
              you are in any doubt.

                  a) Mirrorcaps may allow you to execute Hedged Positions on
                  some Financial Products from time to time. A Hedged Position
                  is an Open Position that is opposite of another Open Position.
                  In other words, it is the same Financial Product, but the
                  opposite direction (i.e., you are the Long Party and the Short
                  Party). A Hedged Position may be a Fully Hedged Position or a
                  Partially Hedged Position.
                </p>
                <p>
                  b) Mirrorcaps reserves the right to reduce the Deposit to zero
                  for Fully Hedged Positions. We also reserve the right to
                  reduce the Deposit for Partially Hedged Positions. If we
                  choose to reduce the Deposit, we do not waive the right to
                  require a deposit at any given time.
                </p>
                <p>
                  c) You acknowledge and agree that if the Deposit for a Hedged
                  Position has been reduced and you close any Open Position that
                  forms part of the Hedged Position, it will immediately trigger
                  the full Deposit for the Open Position. If you do not have
                  sufficient Deposit such Open Position will be closed in
                  accordance with clause 3.2 (c).
                </p>
                <p>
                  d) Mirrorcaps may close all or part of any Hedged Position at
                  any time without notice at the Close-Out Value where we
                  reasonably believe that the Hedged Position is being abused by
                  a Client including where we reasonably believe that such
                  Hedged Positions are not in the ordinary course of trading, or
                  where it constitutes Suspicious Trading Activity. The Company
                  reserves the right to proceed with immediate account
                  termination, with or without prior notification to the client.
                  The Company is further entitled to reverse any profits accrued
                  from suspicious trading and/or terminate the trading account.

                  a) While Mirrorcaps will make every reasonable effort to
                  process the Client's Order promptly, in the absence of gross
                  negligence or wilful misconduct, Mirrorcaps cannot be held
                  liable for delays, damages, failures, or errors in the
                  completion of the Order, including instances of off quotes
                  situations.
                </p>
                <p>
                  b) In the event of a quoting or off quote error, Mirrorcaps:
                  i. is not liable and responsible for any damages, claims,
                  losses, liabilities, or costs arising from the error; ii.
                  reserves the right to restrict or suspend the trading
                  activities of the involved Client until further notice; and
                  iii. reserves the right to make the required adjustments to
                  rectify the error.
                </p>
                <p>
                  c) Any dispute arising from a quoting or off quote error will
                  be resolved based on the fair market value, as determined by
                  Mirrorcaps acting reasonably, of the relevant currency at the
                  time such quoting error occurred.
                </p>
                <p>
                  d) If Mirrorcaps is unable to perform its obligations under
                  this Agreement or an Order because of factors beyond its
                  control or because of a Force Majeure Event, Mirrorcaps will
                  notify the Client as soon as is reasonably practicable and
                  will use reasonable endeavors to secure the return of any
                  money paid by the Client.

                <p>
                  e) Mirrorcaps may give a Notice to the Client at any time if
                  it forms the view that market conditions in the relevant
                  financial market for the currency concerned are seriously
                  disturbed. When such Notice is given, Mirrorcaps's obligations
                  will be suspended while it and the Client negotiate
                  alternative arrangements.

                  a) The Client must pay to Mirrorcaps such amounts of Margin as
                  it may require under this Agreement.
                </p>
                <p>
                  b) A Margin Deposit is credited by Mirrorcaps at the time
                  cleared funds have been received into the Client Account or
                  such earlier time as allowed by Mirrorcaps, so a Margin
                  requirement for any anticipated or Open Positions by
                  Mirrorcaps is not satisfied unless and until the Client's
                  payment is received in cleared funds into the Client Account.
                </p>
                <p>
                  c) Mirrorcaps will not be liable for any losses including
                  losses arising from real or Open Positions if a Margin Deposit
                  or payment is not received in cleared funds into the Client
                  Account.
                </p>
                <p>
                  d) The Client must maintain at least the amount of Margin
                  required by Mirrorcaps whether or not Mirrorcaps gives any
                  notice to the Client to make those payments. The required
                  amount of Margin can change continuously, including over the
                  weekend or other non-trading days.
                </p>
                <p>
                  e) It is the Client's sole responsibility to always monitor
                  through the Mirrorcaps Trading Platform any notifications that
                  Mirrorcaps may provide, the Margin deposited or any Minimum
                  Margin requirement under this Agreement having regard to: your
                  open Positions; the volatility of any relevant Underlying
                  Instrument; the volatility of the Underlying Market and the
                  markets generally; any applicable Exchange Rate risk; and the
                  time it will take for you to remit sufficient cleared funds to
                  Mirrorcaps.
                </p>
                <p>
                  f) The Client must ensure that for as long as they have an
                  Open Position, their account is sufficiently funded to cover
                  the required Margin. If not, the Client's Open Position may be
                  Closed Out by Mirrorcaps without prior notice to the Client.
                </p>
                <p>
                  g) Mirrorcaps may, in its absolute discretion, provide the
                  Client with further time to meet their Margin Requirements.
                  Such permission will only be effective once confirmed in
                  writing by Mirrorcaps and only to the extent provided in the

                  h) If Mirrorcaps asks the Client to transfer money to it to
                  meet its Margin requirement, the client must take this action
                  immediately. If they don't, Mirrorcaps will consider it a
                  Default Event under these terms. Mirrorcaps may also cancel
                  any Orders or Close-Out one or more of the Client's positions
                  at its sole discretion without being liable to the Client.

                  a) The Client is required to maintain a sufficient level of
                  Margin. Mirrorcaps reserves its rights to close out all Open
                  Positions: i. if at any time the Deposit held by Mirrorcaps is
                  approaching or is no longer sufficient to cover the negative
                  mark to market value of any or all Open Positions that the
                  Client has open with Mirrorcaps; or ii. at any time, and from
                  time to time, Mirrorcaps determines that the value of all of
                  the Client's Open Positions represents a substantial net
                  unrealized loss to the Client such that, in Mirrorcaps'
                  belief, the continued trading, or failure to Close Out, one or

                  a) Where an Order for a Spot CFD is held overnight, the Order
                  is subject to a Swap Charge or Swap Credit determined by
                  Mirrorcaps multiplying the value of the contract at the end of
                  the Trading Day by the Reference Interest Rate and adjusted
                  for any dividend in relation to the underlying asset or
                  instrument.
                </p>
                <p>
                  b) Mirrorcaps may, on its website, designate a spot CFD as a
                  swap-free Spot CFD. Where an Order for a swap-free CFD
                  contract is held overnight, the Order will not be subject to a

                  engage in Suspicious Trading Activity with respect to the
                  Order. If the Order remains open for more than seven days, the
                  Order may be subject to a Swap Charge or Swap Credit from day
                  eight onwards. If Mirrorcaps reasonably believes that a Client
                  has engaged in Suspicious Trading Activity with respect to a
                  swap-free Spot CFD, Mirrorcaps reserves the right to apply
                  Swap Charges or Swap Credits retrospectively from the opening
                  of the Order.

                  c) Where an Order for a Spot CFD (except for Cryptocurrency
                  CFD) is held at the Close of Trade on a Friday, the Swap
                  Charge or Swap Credit is adjusted to reflect the cost of

                  b) Where an Order for a Futures CFD is held at the Close of
                  Trade on the Close-Out Date, the Order is automatically rolled
                  over meaning that the contract is closed, and a new Order is
                  created for the Futures CFD on the next Trading Day at the new
                  contract price. Mirrorcaps will not automatically roll over an
                  Open Position for a Futures CFD held at the Close of Trade on
                  the Close-Out Date unless Mirrorcaps has provided reasonable
                  notice to the Client of the Close-Out Date and the position

                  c) Where an Order for a Futures CFD is held at the Close of
                  Trade on the Close-Out Date, an adjustment will be applied to

                  contract price and the new contract price for the Futures CFD
                  less an administration fee of 2.5 basis points payable to

                </p>
                <p>
                  d) Cash adjustments will be applied to the Client's account on
                  the first Trading Day of the new contract.

                  Terms, the Client agrees to pay: i. an amount equal to any
                  other fee charged or levied on Mirrorcaps, or other expense
                  incurred by Mirrorcaps, arising from any action taken pursuant
                  to this Agreement; and ii. all relevant taxes and expenses
                  incurred by the Client in connection with this Agreement.
                </p>
                <p>
                  b) The Client confirms and acknowledges that Mirrorcaps is,
                  without limiting its powers to recover amounts owing by the
                  Client to Mirrorcaps in any other way, permitted to deduct,
                  without further reference to the Client, charges relating to
                  any services provided by Mirrorcaps including administration
                  charges (including but not limited to fees associated with
                  returned cheques, payment processing, debt collection and
                  telephone transcript copies), charges relating to the use of
                  the Online Services and any transaction fees charged to
                  Mirrorcaps by others with respect to the Client's transactions
                  including, but not limited to tracing fees.

                <p>
                  c) Mirrorcaps may in its absolute discretion waive or reduce
                  fees or transaction charges, for individual clients or for
                  classes of clients, for any length of time, with or without

                </p>
                <p>
                  d) The Client acknowledges that should they affect an Order
                  with Mirrorcaps, the Client must pay all transaction charges,
                  fees, settlements, interest and any other amounts due under
                  this Agreement on demand by Mirrorcaps in cleared funds or

                <p>
                  e) The Client agrees that Mirrorcaps may at any time share
                  transaction fees and charges with any other persons without
                  being required to disclose the sharing of such fees and
                  charges to the Client unless such disclosure is required by

                <p>
                  a) Clients who hold a Swap Free Account will be charged an
                  administrative fee instead of being credited or debited with a
                  Swap Charge when holding a position overnight. Mirrorcaps
                  reserves the right to change the administration charges from
                  time to time. Apart from this difference, Swap-Free Accounts
                  have the same trading conditions and terms as Mirrorcaps'
                  regular Client accounts.
                </p>
                <p>
                  b) If a Client holds an existing regular account and wishes to
                  convert that account to a Swap Free Account, the client must
                  make a request in writing to our support team. The conversion
                  from a regular account to a Swap Free Account can only take
                  place if all positions on the regular accounts are closed and
                  the account is reconciled.
                </p>
                <p>
                  c) Swap Free Accounts are to be used in good faith and, the
                  Client may not use the Swap-Free Account to make profits from
                  swaps or, not paying swaps. The Client may not request the
                  payment of any Swap Credit amounts that have been lost as a
                  result of converting Client account(s) into one or more
                  Swap-Free Accounts for the period during which the Client's
                  account(s) have been converted into one or more Swap Free
                  Accounts.
                </p>
                <p>
                  d) Mirrorcaps reserves the right to revoke or cancel a Swap
                  Free Account without having to provide any reason. If
                  Mirrorcaps detects that a Swap Free Account is being abused by
                  taking advantage of not paying swaps, in the form of, but not
                  limited to; fraud, manipulation, cash-back arbitrage, carry
                  trades, or other forms of deceitful or fraudulent activity
                  with the usage of a Swap Free Account, then Mirrorcaps
                  reserves the right to take immediate action with immediate
                  effect, revoking all live trading accounts that are under
                  suspicion of exploitation; correction and recovery of accrued
                  swaps and related accrued interest expenses and/or costs
                  pertaining to and all of the Client's Swap-Free Accounts for

              <p>
                a) A Client's obligations under the Agreement must be
                guaranteed: i. where the Client (including a trustee) is a
                company, by each director of the Company; and ii. in any other
                circumstance, where Mirrorcaps determines, in its absolute
                discretion, that such guarantee is required.
              </p>
              <p>
                b) The Guarantor acknowledges that Mirrorcaps is acting in
                reliance on the Guarantor incurring obligations and giving
                rights under this guarantee and indemnity.
              </p>
              <p>
                c) The Guarantor unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees to
                Mirrorcaps compliance with their obligations in connection with
                the Agreement, including each obligation to pay money.
              </p>
              <p>
                d) If the Client does not comply with those obligations on time
                and in accordance with the Agreement, then the Guarantor agrees
                to comply with those obligations on demand from Mirrorcaps. A
                demand may be made whether Mirrorcaps has made demand on the
                Client.
              </p>
              <p>
                e) The Guarantor indemnifies Mirrorcaps against any liability or
                loss arising from, and any costs it incurs, if: i. the Client
                does not, or is unable to, comply with an obligation the Client
                has (including an obligation to pay money) in connection with
                the Agreement; or ii. an obligation the Client would otherwise

                an obligation the Guarantor would otherwise have under clause 6
                is found to be unenforceable; or iv. a representation or
                warranty by the Client in the Agreement is found to have been
                incorrect or misleading when made.
              </p>
              <p>
                f) The Guarantor agrees to pay amounts due under clause 6 on

              </p>
              <p>
                g) Mirrorcaps needs not incur expense or make payment before
                enforcing this right of indemnity.
              </p>
              <p>
                h) The guarantee in clause 6 is a continuing obligation despite
                any intervening payment, settlement or other thing and extends
                to all of the Client's obligations in connection with the
                Agreement. The Guarantor waives any right it has of first
                requiring Mirrorcaps to commence proceedings or enforce any
                other rights against the Client or any other person before
                claiming from the Guarantor under this guarantee and indemnity.

                i) The Guarantor acknowledges that, before entering into this
                guarantee and indemnity, it: i. was given a copy of the
                Agreement and had full opportunity to consider their provisions;
                and ii. is responsible for making itself aware of the Client's
                financial position and any other person who guarantees any of
                the Client's obligations in connection with the Agreement.
              </p>

                j) The Guarantor agrees to make payments under this guarantee
                and indemnity: i. in full without set-off or counterclaim, and
                without any withholding or deduction unless prohibited by law;
                and ii. in the currency in which the payment is due, and
                otherwise in United States dollars, in immediately available
                funds.
              </p>
              <p>
                k) If the Guarantor makes a payment that is subject to any
                withholding or deduction, the Guarantor agrees to pay Mirrorcaps
                such additional amount to ensure that the amount received by
                Mirrorcaps equals the full amount Mirrorcaps would have received
                had no withholding or deduction been made.
              </p>
              <p>
                l) The rights given to Mirrorcaps under this guarantee and
                indemnity, and the Guarantor's liabilities under it, are not
                affected by any act or omission of us or any other person. For
                example, those rights and liabilities are not affected by any
                act or omission: i. varying or replacing the Agreement;
                releasing the Client or giving the Client a concession; ii.
                releasing any person who gives a guarantee or indemnity in
                connection with any of the Client's obligations; iii. by which a
                person becomes a Guarantor after the date of this guarantee and
                indemnity; iv. by which the obligations of any person who
                guarantees any of the Client's obligations may become
                unenforceable; v. by which any person who was intended to
                guarantee any of the obligations does not do so or does not do
                so effectively; vi. by which a person who is co-surety or
                co-indemnifier is discharged under a Client Agreement or by
                operation of law; vii. a person dealing in any way with the
                Agreement or this guarantee and indemnity; viii. the death,
                mental or physical disability, or liquidation, administration or
                insolvency of any person including the Client or the Guarantor;
                ix. changes in the membership, name or business of any person;
                x. acquiescence or delay by Mirrorcaps or any other person.
              </p>
              <p>
                m) If any obligation is required, or may be required, to be
                complied with in connection with this guarantee and indemnity,
                the Guarantor may not, without our consent: i. reduce its
                liability under this guarantee and indemnity by claiming that
                the Client or any other person has a right of set-off or
                counterclaim against Mirrorcaps; or ii. exercise any legal right
                to claim to be entitled to the benefit of another guarantee,
                indemnity, mortgage, charge or other encumbrance given in
                connection with the Agreement; or iii. claim an amount from the
                Client, or another guarantor under a right of indemnity; or iv.
                claim an amount in your liquidation, administration or
                insolvency or of another guarantor of any of your obligations.

              <p>
                a) If a Corporate Action occurs, Mirrorcaps will reasonably
                determine what adjustment, if any, should be made to an Order to
                account for the dilutive or concentrative effect of any such
                event to preserve the economic equivalent of such Orders prior
                to the relevant event or to reflect the effect of such event on
                such Orders. Any such adjustments will be effective as of a date
                reasonably determined by us.
              </p>
              <p>
                b) Mirrorcaps will make dividend payments if: i. a Client is the
                Long Party for a Share CFD which goes ex-dividend, Mirrorcaps
                will credit the Client's account with a cash adjustment to
                reflect the impact of the dividend on the Orders. The amount of
                the adjustment will depend on the amount of the gross dividend
                on the relevant number of Share CFDs on the ex-dividend date;
                ii. a Client is the Short Party for a Share CFD which goes
                ex-dividend, Mirrorcaps will debit the declared cash dividend
                from the Client's account. The amount of the adjustment will
                depend on the amount equal to the gross dividend on the relevant
                number of Share CFDs on the ex-dividend date.
              </p>
              <p>
                c) If an underlying asset to which an Open Position relates is
                subject to a Merger Event, Mirrorcaps reserves the right to
                close any or all affected Open Positions at any time during the
                Merger Event. Mirrorcaps will not close any Open Position that
                is subject to a Merger Event unless it has provided reasonable
                notice to the Client of a deadline for the Client to close their
                Open Position and the position remains open after this deadline.
              </p>
              <p>
                d) Mirrorcaps reserves the right to adjust the opening price of
                any Financial Product that is subject to a Merger Event to
                reflect any cash portion of the offeror to amend the size to
                reflect any corresponding adjustment to the underlying asset
                caused by the Merger Event and/or to close the affected Open
                Positions and reopen a new position reflecting the new
                underlying asset that has been created.
              </p>
              <p>
                e) Where there is no reasonable basis for determining an
                adjustment under clause 7(e) which would produce a commercially
                reasonable result, Mirrorcaps may close your Open Position at
                the Close-Out Value on a date reasonably determined by us.
              </p>
              <p>
                f) Where the Client is the Long Party for a Share CFD in
                relation to a US stock or security, and the Share CFD goes
                ex-dividend, Mirrorcaps is required by US tax legislation to
                withhold 30% of the cash adjustment to reflect the impact of the
                declared dividend. Mirrorcaps will remit the amount withheld to
                its liquidity provider who will account the withheld amounts to
                the proper US authorities. Clients can view amounts withheld for
                US tax legislation purposes from their account.

                exchange is suspended or halted; or ii. trading is suspended or
                halted on any exchange which restricts trading with any relevant
                index so that Mirrorcaps is unable to determine the price of the
                Underlying Asset, then Mirrorcaps will take the price of the
                Underlying Asset as being the last traded price before the
                trading suspension or halt.
              </p>

                b) If the suspension or halt continue for 5 Business Days,
                Mirrorcaps at its discretion may Close-Out your part or all of

                Close-Out date and the Close-Out value of your Contract in good
                faith (the Close-Out value will be the Underlying Asset price x

                c) Mirrorcaps reserves the right at all times during any

                price of any affected Underlying Asset.

                  termination by either party shall not affect any Order or

                Client authorizes Mirrorcaps to: i. appropriate, transfer,
                credit, apply or pay monies that may be received or held by
                Mirrorcaps the Client's behalf in payment of any amounts which
                may be outstanding by the Client to Mirrorcaps or to an agent of
                Mirrorcaps in a transaction effected on the Client's behalf; and
                ii. set-off against any amounts due to it by the Client, any
                amounts received by Mirrorcaps from or on behalf of the Client
                including but not limited to monies received as Deposits or
                Margin Calls. Mirrorcaps may determine the application of any

              </p>
              <p>
                b) Payments by the Client to Mirrorcaps in accordance with this
                Agreement must be made without any set-off, counterclaim or
                condition and without any deduction or withholding for any tax
                or any other reason unless the deduction or withholding is

              </p>
              <p>
                c) Should the Client be required to make any form of deduction
                in respect of tax from any payment to be made or if Mirrorcaps
                is required to pay any tax in respect of any payment made in
                relation to this Agreement at the Client's request the Client
                agrees to keep Mirrorcaps indemnified against that tax and
                agrees to pay to Mirrorcaps any additional amounts required to
                ensure Mirrorcaps receives the full net amount that is equal to
                the amount Mirrorcaps would have received had a deduction,
                withholding or payment of tax not been made.

                Agreement and under or in respect of any other account between
                Mirrorcaps and the Client are satisfied in full. Until this
                time, Deposits or Margin Calls will not constitute a debt due
                from Mirrorcaps to the Client nor will the Client have any right
                to receive payment of these funds.
              </p>
              <p>
                e) If the Agreement is terminated, the Client and Mirrorcaps
                agree that the claims against each other are finally discharged
                by means of close-out netting. Mirrorcaps will determine the
                Close-Out Values for each affected Order in its sole discretion.
                The final amount to be paid by one of the parties will be the

              <p>
                The trading systems of Mirrorcaps are designed with safeguards
                to protect clients from encountering negative balances when
                trading under normal market conditions. All clients are provided
                with margin monitoring functionality. This functionality
                monitors the level of collateral should it drop below 100% of
                the required margin. If it drops below 100%, the margin call
                mode will be triggered and maintained until the level of 50%.
                Should the margin level equal to, or drop below 50%, Mirrorcaps
                will initiate the closing of current open positions, starting
                from the most unprofitable considering trading hours of
                instruments traded by the client. Positions will be closed
                automatically at the current market price. The clients can set
                personal limits for risk management purposes.
              </p>
              <p>
                Should a client incur a negative balance due to a "market gap",
                the client should inform the Mirrorcaps support team. Mirrorcaps
                will evaluate the inquiry and at its discretion, may credit the
                client's account with the amount of the negative balance where
                the debit was during normal trading activity. This policy is

                credit reference agencies in order to verify the Client's

                b) Mirrorcaps reserves the right to collect such information as
                is necessary from the Client to meet its obligations under the
                Money Laundering Prevention Act and the applicable Anti-Money
                Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Laws. Mirrorcaps may

                Financing checks in relation to the Client (including restricted
                lists, blocked persons and countries lists) as deemed necessary

                e) Mirrorcaps will use reasonable precautions to maintain the
                confidentiality of information Mirrorcaps receives from the

                inputs or develops in connection with the Client's use of the
                Mirrorcaps services. Nonetheless, because such information,
                material and/or data may be provided through the internet, the
                Client hereby acknowledges and agrees that Mirrorcaps cannot
                assure that such information, material and/or data will continue
                to be confidential.

                releases and indemnifies Mirrorcaps from any claim arising out
                of a Third-Party intercepting, accessing, monitoring or
                receiving any communication from a Client intended to be
                provided to Mirrorcaps or from Mirrorcaps intended to be
                provided to the Client.
              </p>
              <p>
                g) The Client acknowledges and agrees that Mirrorcaps may

                information about the Client, and any relevant details of an
                Authorized User, to its employees, representatives, officers,
                agents, introducing brokers and affiliates, as well as to a

                service provider or any other Third-Party agent or service
                provider for any purpose related to offering, providing,
                administering or maintaining the Mirrorcaps services, or to

              </p>

                h) Due to the inherent risks in transferring currency between
                parties located in different countries, Mirrorcaps takes
                measures to ensure that it is not participating or assisting in
                money laundering or terrorist financing. Law enforcement
                agencies and regulatory authorities may periodically inspect and
                require copies of Client information and business records held
                by Mirrorcaps, to ensure compliance with all applicable
                anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing laws.

                Mirrorcaps, may be disclosed to and reviewed by law enforcement
                agencies and regulatory authorities. In addition, the Client
                agrees to comply with all applicable anti-money laundering and
                counter-terrorism financing laws, including, but not limited to,
                the requirement to obtain satisfactory evidence of the identity
                of any principal whom the Client may represent in any
                transaction entered into with Mirrorcaps.

                a) Mirrorcaps is required by the anti-money laundering and
                counter-terrorism financing regulations to verify a Client's
                identity before it can provide the Client with its services.
                Electronic verification allows Mirrorcaps to verify a Client's
                identity by using electronic tools and external data sources.
