              Money laundering is the process of converting funds, received from
              illegal activities (such as fraud, corruption, terrorism, etc.),
              into other funds or investments that look legitimate to hide or
              distort the real source of funds.

                can also be physically deposited into banks and non-bank
                institutions (e.g., currency exchangers). To avoid suspicion by
                the company, the launderer may as well make several deposits
                instead of depositing the whole sum at once, this form of
